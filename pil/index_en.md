# Programming Innovation Lab

## News
- March 9, 2025: Tanno presented [C# Real-time Debugger Exhibition](contents/20250309-mitoukaigi/index.md) (in Japanese) at [Mitou Conference 2025](https://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/mitoukaigi/).

## About the Institute

The Programming Innovation Lab is an individual research and development organization that explores the future of software development.\
From a developer's perspective, we tackle technical challenges with two core pillars: "exploration based on pure technical interest" and "practical problem-solving."

## Mission
- Begin by solving challenges that developers themselves face, then elevate these solutions to social value
- Build environments that make programming enjoyable and efficient
- Establish technical education environments where everyone can express creativity through programming

## Approach
- Free exploration based on technical interest
- Problem-solving where we become the first users ourselves
- Elevate individual solutions to universal value through systematic knowledge and community dialogue
- Social contribution of gained insights (information dissemination, education/mentoring)

## Activities
### (1) Research and Development
We are currently advancing research and development in the following areas:
- (a) Program Understanding and Debugging Support Technologies
   - Investigation of real-time debugging technologies for applications with high interactivity and real-time performance, such as web and game applications
- (b) Programming Learning Support Technologies
   - Investigation of teaching and learning environments for instructors and beginners of programming and low-code applications

### (2) Technical Information Dissemination
We write beginner-friendly technical blogs and provide video explanations to promote programming and support learning.\
We also conduct lectures on software engineering as external lecturers at universities.

### (3) Mentoring
We provide small-group individual mentoring to support developer growth.
